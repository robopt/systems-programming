DEMO CODE
---------
The code that was used during the demo is found in baseline.


64-BIT CODE
-----------
The code for the (broken) 64-bit version is found in baselin-64bit.


64-BIT DIFFS
------------
In case you'd like to take a look at the list of not-working changes for the
64-bit system, I've included these. That way, you don't have to mess around with
git.


RUST CODE
---------
The (unmerged) Rust code is in the rust directory. I've included a main.rs and
a precompiled main to do a quick demo of the priority queue and allocator and
how that works.

Because this stuff was very unstable when I made it, it seems to be that the
destructor for Person doesn't work any more, so, I commented it out. Rest
assured that this did work at one point, though.
